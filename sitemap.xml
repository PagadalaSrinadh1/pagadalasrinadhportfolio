<!-- 
  This is an XML sitemap, a file that lists the important pages of a website,
  making it easier for search engines (like Google, Bing) to crawl and understand
  the site's structure.
-->
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <!-- 
    The <urlset> tag is the root element and encloses all the URLs.
    The xmlns attribute specifies the XML namespace for sitemaps.
  -->

  <url>
    <!-- 
      Each <url> entry represents a single page on your website.
    -->

    <loc>https://srinadhpersonalportfolio.netlify.app/</loc>
    <!-- 
      <loc>: The absolute URL of the page. 
      This should be your ACTUAL live URL where the portfolio is hosted.
    -->

    <lastmod>2024-05-21</lastmod>
    <!-- 
      <lastmod>: The date of the last modification of the page.
      Format: YYYY-MM-DD.
      UPDATE THIS DATE whenever you make significant changes to the content of this page.
      This helps search engines know when to re-crawl the page for new content.
    -->

    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <!-- 
      <changefreq>: How frequently the page is likely to change.
      Valid values: always, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never.
      For a personal portfolio that isn't updated daily, 'monthly' or 'yearly' is often appropriate.
      If you update projects or skills frequently, 'monthly' is a good choice.
    -->

    <priority>1.0</priority>
    <!--
      <priority>: The priority of this URL relative to other URLs on your site.
      Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0.
      A higher value (like 1.0) indicates higher importance.
      For a single-page portfolio, the main page is usually the most important, hence 1.0.
      If you had multiple pages (e.g., /projects, /about), you might set the homepage to 1.0
      and other important pages to 0.8 or 0.9.
    -->
  </url>

  <!-- 
    If your portfolio had multiple distinct pages (e.g., a separate blog page, a detailed projects page),
    you would add more <url> entries here for each of them.
    For a single-page application (SPA) like this portfolio, where content is loaded dynamically
    but essentially represents one main "document" from a search engine's perspective for this URL,
    one entry is typically sufficient.
    If you had distinct, crawlable URLs for different sections (e.g., if #projects was accessible
    as a separate page like /projects), you'd list those. But since it's a single HTML file
    with fragment identifiers (#home, #skills), one entry for the base URL is correct.
